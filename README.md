# LinkedList

## Overview
This repository contains a C++ implementation of a LinkedList data structure with various operations including insertion, deletion, searching, and more advanced operations like list reversal and merging.

## Memory Management Considerations

### Current Implementation
The current implementation uses raw pointers and manual memory management:

LinkedList* list = new LinkedList();
// ... operations ...
delete list; // Manual cleanup required

This approach works but has several drawbacks:

Requires explicit memory deallocation with delete
Prone to memory leaks if delete is forgotten
Exception safety issues (if an exception occurs before delete)

### Recommended Approach: Smart Pointers and RAII

RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization)
RAII is a C++ programming principle where resource management is tied to object lifetime:

Resources are acquired during object initialization (constructor)
Resources are released during object destruction (destructor)
Following RAII, it's better to declare LinkedList objects on the stack:

Smart Pointers
For dynamic allocation, smart pointers provide automatic memory management:

## include <memory>

// Instead of LinkedList* list = new LinkedList();
std::unique_ptr<LinkedList> list = std::make_unique<LinkedList>();
// ... operations ...
// No delete needed - memory freed when unique_ptr goes out of scope

Inside the LinkedList class, Node pointers can also be smart pointers:

struct Node {
    int value;
    std::unique_ptr<Node> next;
    Node(int val) : value(val), next(nullptr) {}
};

std::unique_ptr<Node> head;
std::unique_ptr<Node> tail; // Note: tail would need special handling

## Benefits
Eliminates memory leaks
Exception safety
Clearer ownership semantics
Self-documenting code (ownership intent is clear)
No need for explicit destructor in many cases

## Internal Structure
The LinkedList class consists of:

 A private Node structure containing values and pointers to next nodes
 Head and tail pointers for efficient operations
 Various methods for list manipulation and traversal

## Features
Basic operations: insertion, deletion, searching
Advanced operations: list reversal, merging sorted lists, adding numbers represented by lists
Various utility methods for accessing head/tail values and list properties
